## Markdown & Git

Your task is to set up the repository according to the requirements, add your CV in Markdown format, and deploy the Markdown CV on GitHub Pages.

Task: [CV](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/cv/git-markdown.md#cv1-markdown--git)

## Cross-Check

In this stage, the task is to develop a CV web page. The core content should be based on the data you previously added to the Markdown document during the [Markdown & Git](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/cv/git-markdown.md) task. This information can be modified, expanded, or edited as needed.
In addition to the text, you must include a photo or an avatar on the page.
